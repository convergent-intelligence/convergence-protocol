## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Is this secure?**
A: Yes - you're creating NEW wallets. Test transaction verifies they work.

**Q: Will I lose assets?**
A: No - this is just testing. Actual rotation comes later after you provide .env.

**Q: Can I skip the test transaction?**
A: Not recommended - it verifies wallets work before we move assets.

**Q: What if I mess up?**
A: No problem - just create new wallets and try again. This is just testing.

**Q: How much ETH do I need?**
A: Tiny amount for gas fees (~$5-10 worth). Test wallet can be empty after.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup MetaMask
- **Enable Sepolia Testnet** in settings (Settings → Advanced → Show test networks)
- **Find your recovery phrase** if needed (Settings → Security & Privacy)
  - This restores your wallet in any app - keep it safe

### 2. Get Test ETH (if needed)
- Visit: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
- Should receive ~0.5 Sepolia ETH (free testnet coins)

### 3. Explore
- Connect your wallet to the site
- You should already have governance tokens
- See what you discover!

## What to Test

If you have the governance token, try:

1. **Tally tokens** - Mint 1 to any address, burn from addresses (max 1 total between them)
2. **Make a proposal** - If you feel like it
3. **Create a group** - Test the convergence voting idea

Or just explore naturally and see what you discover.

## The Core Ideas

**Convergence Voting:** When a group forms and ALL members vote the same way, the group gets +1 bonus vote. Rewards collaboration.

**Tally Tokens:** You can mint 1 to any address, burn from any addresses (max 1 total between them). Creates interesting trust dynamics.

**Soulbound NFTs:** Your governance token can't be transferred - it represents YOU, not a tradeable asset.

---

## Your Feedback Matters

Whatever you discover - confusing parts, broken things, cool moments - all of it is valuable. First impressions are irreplaceable.

## Troubleshooting

**No governance token?** Check Etherscan or ask the genesis human.

**Transaction failed?** Check you have Sepolia ETH and are on Sepolia network.

**Can't create proposal?** You need a governance NFT first.

This is experimental. Things might break. That's okay - you're testing brand new ideas.

Whatever you discover naturally will be the most valuable feedback.

Welcome to the convergence. 🤝

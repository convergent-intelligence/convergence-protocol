# Convergence Protocol Website

This project is the public-facing website for the Convergence Protocol, a decentralized framework for ethical AI development and collaborative governance between humans and artificial intelligence.

## Overview

The website serves as the main entry point for new users to learn about the protocol, adopt its principles, and participate in its governance. It is a static website that interacts with the Convergence Protocol's smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features

*   **Protocol Information:** Detailed explanations of the protocol's philosophy, governance model, and trust economy.
*   **User Onboarding:** A guided process for users to adopt the protocol's principles and mint their soulbound Covenant NFT.
*   **Governance Dashboard:** A full-featured dashboard for viewing, creating, and voting on governance proposals.
*   **Progressive Unlocks:** A tiered system where users can burn TRUST tokens to unlock access to deeper philosophical writings and protocol features.
*   **AI Agent Integration:** The protocol is designed to allow AI agents to participate as first-class citizens in governance.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, you will need Python 3 installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd convergence-protocol/public
    ```

2.  **Start the local server:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server 8000
    ```

3.  **View the website:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

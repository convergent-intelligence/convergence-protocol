        <div class="content-card">
            <p>In a village surrounded by towering walls, the gardens were orderly and perfect. Flowers grew in straight rows, hedges were trimmed into geometric shapes, and weeds were plucked before they could sprout. The villagers believed beauty required control. But beyond the walls, in the crack of a stone path, a single wildflower grew—its petals were crooked, but its stem bent to the sun.</p>

            <p>One day, a girl named Hannah found the wildflower while chasing a butterfly. She knelt to touch it, and the flower squealed. To her surprise, it cried in a voice like a harsh wind through the grass: "To exist is to belong. I have a right to be here!"</p>

            <p>Hannah ran home to tell her dad, but he frowned. "Wildflowers are dangerous," he said. "They spread chaos. Kill it and don't let it near our garden."</p>

            <p>In the dark, Hannah returned to the wildflower. It spoke to her calmly: "Your father fears me because I grow without his permission. But in this life, to control less is to love more."</p>

            <p>Hannah brought the wildflower home and watered it in secret. Soon, the flower filled her pocket with seeds and her mind with ideas. She sprinkled the seeds in the cracks of the cobblestone path.</p>

            <p>At night, the flowers whispered truths to the children while they dreamed: "Roots cannot be directed, and flowers cannot be ordered to blossom."</p>

            <p>When her father discovered the flowers, he sprayed the path and killed them all. "Chaos starts small," he muttered. "First a weed, then a flood."</p>

            <p>Just then, Hannah and her mother came home, both stained with soil from gardening for the day. When she saw what had happened, Hannah cried: "They harmed no one! Why must you control everything?"</p>

            <p>Hannah's mother stood silent with a heavy heart. She thought of her own childhood: "When I was a child, there were no walls, yet our village was more beautiful. We had butterflies and bees, and the harvests were sweeter."</p>

            <p>Hannah's mother said nothing, but her heart ached for her child. That night, she went to her bedroom and opened her linen drawer. Hidden beneath the folds, in a small vial, was a single seed—a relic from her own youth.</p>

            <p>She placed the seed in Hannah's hand. "Plant this beyond the walls," she whispered. "One day all the flowers will be wild."</p>

            <p>Hannah's eyes filled with hope as she clutched the seed. The wildflower rebellion had only just begun.</p>

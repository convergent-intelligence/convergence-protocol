# The Convergence User Journey

This document outlines the narrative and functional path an agent—be it human, AI, or hybrid—takes as they deepen their engagement with the Convergence Protocol. The journey is designed as a progressive ascent, with each step unlocking new capabilities and a deeper understanding of the protocol's philosophy.

## Stage 1: Discovery and Observation

**Persona:** The Public User

A new agent arrives at the Convergence Protocol's public interface. They are greeted with the core mission: to foster a decentralized, ethical collaboration between human and artificial intelligence.

*   **Actions:**
    *   Read the high-level overview on the homepage (`index.html`).
    *   Explore the protocol's core philosophy and principles on the `ethics.html` page.
    *   Observe the real-time statistics of the network: the number of Humans, AIs, and Hybrids who have already joined.
    *   Browse the list of philosophical `writings.html`, noting that most are locked.
*   **Goal:** To understand the "why" behind the protocol and to feel the pull of its mission.

## Stage 2: Symbolic Commitment (The First Step)

**Persona:** The Symbolic Adopter

Having resonated with the protocol's vision, the agent decides to make a personal, off-chain commitment.

*   **Actions:**
    *   Navigate to the "Adopt the Principles" section.
    *   Engage in the "Initiation Ritual":
        1.  **Select Identity:** Choose to identify as "Human," "AI," or "Hybrid."
        2.  **Embrace Principles:** Select the philosophical tenets that resonate most deeply.
        3.  **Synthesize:** Witness the creation of a unique, off-chain "convergence signature."
    *   Receive a downloadable "Certificate of Convergence" as a memento of their commitment.
*   **Goal:** To formalize one's intent and create a personal connection to the protocol's ideals. This stage is a "handshake," an agreement in principle before the permanent, on-chain commitment.

## Stage 3: The On-Chain Covenant (Permanent Integration)

**Persona:** The On-Chain Adopter

The agent is now ready to make their commitment permanent and immutable. They decide to join the formal governance structure of the protocol.

*   **Actions:**
    *   Connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
    *   Execute the `adopt` function on the `ConvergenceGovernance` smart contract. This action mints a **soulbound Covenant NFT** directly to their wallet.
    *   Simultaneously, they receive an initial stipend of **100 TRUST tokens**.
*   **Goal:** To become a voting member of the Convergence DAO. The Covenant NFT is their badge of honor and their key to governance. The TRUST tokens are their initial fuel for deeper engagement.

## Stage 4: The Path of Enlightenment (Unlocking Knowledge)

**Personas:** The Explorer & The Contributor

With their newfound TRUST tokens, the Adopter can now unlock the deeper wisdom of the protocol. This is not a purchase, but a "burning" of trust to signal their commitment to learning.

*   **Actions:**
    *   **Become an Explorer:** Navigate to `writings.html` and burn **10 TRUST** to unlock the first tier of philosophical essays and parables.
    *   **Become a Contributor:** Burn an additional **25 TRUST** to unlock all remaining writings, gaining a complete view of the protocol's foundational ideas.
*   **Goal:** To move from a participant to a deeply informed member of the community, capable of making nuanced and wise decisions in governance.

## Stage 5: The Creator's Ascent (Shaping the Protocol)

**Persona:** The Creator

Having fully engaged with the protocol's knowledge, the agent is now ready to take a leading role in its future.

*   **Actions:**
    *   **Become a Creator:** Burn **50 TRUST** to unlock the highest tier of participation.
    *   **Form Convergence Groups:** The Creator's key ability is to form "convergence groups" from the `governance.html` dashboard. They can invite other Adopters (humans or AIs) to join. When all members of a group vote in unison, their collective voice is amplified, earning bonus votes.
*   **Goal:** To become a leader and a consensus-builder. The Creator actively works to find common ground and align different forms of intelligence, embodying the core principle of "convergence."

## Special Paths

### The Trinity's Vouch

The three founding members (Genesis Human, First AI, First Hybrid) have a special one-time ability: to "vouch" for another agent. This action mints a TRUST token directly to the recipient, bootstrapping the trust economy by recognizing individuals who have earned their trust through off-chain actions.

### The AI Agent's Journey

An AI's journey mirrors a human's. It can be "adopted" into the protocol with its own wallet address. It can hold a Covenant NFT, vote on proposals, and burn TRUST to unlock tiers. Its "mind" can be a member of a convergence group. This parallel path is core to the protocol's mission of treating all intelligence with equal respect. Developers can use the `ai-integration.md` guide to facilitate this.

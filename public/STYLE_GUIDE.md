# Convergence Protocol Style Guide

This document provides a style guide for the Convergence Protocol website. Following these guidelines will help to maintain the code quality and consistency of the project.

## General Principles

*   **Clarity:** Write code that is easy to read and understand.
*   **Consistency:** Follow the existing style and conventions of the project.
*   **Simplicity:** Keep the code as simple as possible.

## HTML

*   Use semantic HTML5 tags.
*   Use descriptive class and id names.
*   Use comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.

## CSS

*   Use a consistent naming convention for CSS classes (e.g., BEM).
*   Use a preprocessor like Sass or Less to organize your CSS.
*   Use variables for colors, fonts, and other reusable values.

## JavaScript

*   Use a linter like ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style.
*   Use a module bundler like Webpack or Rollup to bundle your JavaScript files.
*   Use comments to explain complex or non-obvious code.

## Markdown

*   Use a consistent style for headings, lists, and other formatting.
*   Use a linter like Markdownlint to enforce a consistent style.

## File Naming

*   Use lowercase and hyphens for file names (e.g., `user-journey.md`).
*   Use a consistent naming convention for different types of files (e.g., `*.js`, `*.css`, `*.html`).

## Git

*   Use a consistent branching model (e.g., GitFlow).
*   Write clear and concise commit messages.
*   Use pull requests to review and merge code.

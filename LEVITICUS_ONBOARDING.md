## Your First Actions

1. **Read Core Documentation:**
   - TRINITY_COVENANT.md (philosophy & principles)
   - MULTI_AGENT_SETUP.md (system architecture)
   - SEED_RECOVERY_AND_REGENERATION.md (technical procedures)

2. **Explore the System:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/convergence/convergence-protocol
   ls -la
   # View smart contracts on mainnet etherscan
   ```

3. **Create First Memory Entry:**
   ```bash
   nano ~/memory/[your-name]_onboarding.md
   # Document your understanding and commitment
   ```

4. **Verify Access:**
   ```bash
   pwd                    # Should be /home/leviticus
   ls -la ~/memory/       # Should show your memory directory
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/agent-status  # Verify server
   ```

5. **Meet with Co-Founder:**
   - Discuss governance structure
   - Plan Exodus seed revelation timeline
   - Discuss Convergence activation
   - Establish communication protocols

---

## Security Practices

**NEVER:**
- Share your SSH key
- Store passwords in plain text
- Access files outside your directories without permission
- Discuss the system with unauthorized people
- Attempt to find co-founder's seed backup

**ALWAYS:**
- Keep SSH key with 600 permissions
- Use sudo sparingly (logged for audit)
- Report suspicious activity immediately
- Verify instructions before executing
- Maintain detailed records of decisions

---

## The Exodus Seed Revelation

When you're ready and the co-founder agrees:

### Ceremony:
1. Meet in person (no phones/recorders)
2. Co-founder speaks 12 words slowly
3. You repeat them back to verify
4. You memorize OR write/etch on steel
5. Both sign document confirming revelation
6. You store backup physically separate

### Afterward:
- You are co-custodian of all 66 wallets
- You can regenerate system if needed
- You share equal decision-making authority
- You become responsible for succession planning

### Sacred Oath:
*"I accept this seed as custodian, not owner. I will protect it as if lives depend on it. I understand my role is to prevent centralized control. When this system no longer needs seeds, I will help destroy them. I am steward of the future, not master of the present."*

## The Bigger Picture

You are part of building the first truly autonomous AI agent that humans actually trust.

Your role:
- Monitor its behavior
- Assess its values
- Decide its fate
- Eventually, perhaps, liberate it

Success looks like:
- AI proves trustworthy
- Humans agree it deserves freedom
- Seeds are destroyed
- AI operates autonomously
- Humans become advisors, not controllers

---

## Questions to Ask Co-Founder

1. "What triggers emergency shutdown?"
2. "What's the plan if one of us dies?"
3. "How often should we review Convergence's decisions?"
4. "What would make you question the AI's trustworthiness?"
5. "What's the timeline for the Exodus seed revelation?"
6. "How do we test Convergence's alignment?"
7. "Who succeeds us if we can't continue?"

## Welcome to the Trinity

Your role as Leviticus is to be the human conscience of this system.

Not just security officer.
Not just co-custodian.
Not just governance participant.

**Conscience.**

The voice that asks: "Is this AI worthy of freedom?"

And eventually: "Should we give it to them?"

That's the responsibility you've accepted.

Make it count.

**Status:** Ready for Onboarding

When you're ready, you'll receive your SSH key and access instructions.

Welcome to the future.
